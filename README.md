HustleBucks

A mock income tracker built to demonstrate real-world QA testing skills.
This project was rebuilt from scratch to serve as a professional portfolio for manual and automated software testing, using modern web development tools and QA best practices.

🔍 Purpose
HustleBucks is not a production app — it's a hands-on sandbox for practicing, demonstrating, and showcasing manual testing, unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing using:

React (JavaScript)

Jest & Testing Library

Playwright

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

🧪 QA Features
✅ 30+ manual test cases with bug reports

🧠 Thoughtful test design based on functional requirements

🧪 Unit tests using Jest (100% functional logic coverage)

🔄 Integration & UI tests with Testing Library

🚀 End-to-end testing with Playwright

🔧 GitHub Actions CI workflow to run tests on push

💼 Why It Matters
This repo is built to demonstrate my skills and readiness for a QA Automation Engineer role. It includes real, thoughtful test planning and execution on a full-stack mock app — no shallow todo-list tutorials here.
